# fastapi-services-oauth2

This repository provides an approach on how to structure FastAPI application with 
multiple services, simple OAuth2 authentication, and Postgres backend.

## Structure overview

Application consists of 5 packages. Service related functionality is provided by 
`routers`, `services`, `schemas`, and `models` packages. Adding a new service requires 
adding a new module in each of these packages. 

```bash
    .
    └── app/
        ├── backend             # Backend functionality and configs
        |   ├── config.py           # Configuration settings
        │   └── database.py         # Database session manager
        ├── models              # SQLAlchemy models
        │   ├── auth.py             # Authentication models
        |   ├── base.py             # Base classes, mixins
        |   └── ...                 # Service models
        ├── routers             # API routes
        |   ├── auth.py             # Authentication routers
        │   └── ...                 # Service routers
        ├── schemas             # Pydantic models
        |   ├── auth.py              
        │   └── ...
        ├── services            # Business logic
        |   ├── auth.py             # Create user, generate and verify tokens
        |   ├── base.py             # Base classes, mixins
        │   └── ...
        ├── cli.py              # Command-line utilities
        ├── const.py            # Constants
        ├── exc.py              # Exception handlers
        └── main.py             # Application runner
```

Package `backend` provides database session manager and configs. In case, application 
communicates not only with database, but also with other backends (e.g. other API), 
the corresponding clients can be placed in `backend`.

Module `cli` provides command-line functionality related to API services but not required
access through API endpoints. It's main focus is to complete tasks that need to be done 
manually or by scheduler. For instance, create a new user and store its hashed data in database.

Module `main` represents FastAPI entry point and initiates `app` object (instance of `FastAPI` class).
This `app` is referred by server when running `uvicorn main:app` command.
